# OpenALU
- Literally what the name suggests - ALU simulator in P/N transistor level
- JAVA because it is a JAVA project. Rust or C would be much better for bigger project
- YES YOU CAN INDEED RUN DOOM (If you're insane enough, just need to add memory module, clock input? just use binary for input lmao or program your own IO)
